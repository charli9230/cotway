                    <p>COTWAY (Church On The Way) is a student and family-friendly church, situated in walking distance from NMMU North and South campus, on Admiralty Way. Otherwise known as “the big white Church” in Summerstrand. COTWAY is a “home away from home” for many students; we meet every Sunday at COTWAY to worship God and hear his Word. As some of us are far away from home, We view Our leaders, Rev Pastor Vic and Lathicia Klackers, as our spiritual parents; offering guidance and assistance in times of need. COTWAY’s vision is to impact the lives of others with the love of Jesus Christ. We are a friendly, safe community and we’d love to see you at 9am on Sunday!</p>
